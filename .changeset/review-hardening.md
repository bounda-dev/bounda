Hardening and cleanup from a review of the whole code base.

Security. The Worker of `createWorker` knows only the app's own commands and queries: a name such as `constructor` or `toString`, which the route admitted and a plain lookup resolved to a function of `Object.prototype`, is a 404 like any unknown one. It refuses a body over `maxPayloadBytes`, `DEFAULT_MAX_PAYLOAD_BYTES` by default, with a 413 before reading it. An event or a delayed command whose handler or caller writes a sealed envelope itself, in any field, marked or not, is refused with a `ValidationError`: what the kernel reads is opened by its shape, so such a value could only read back as `null`, or not at all under the person's current key. The React Router middleware leaves alone a form that declares a length over a mebibyte instead of reading its `idempotencyKey` field from a copy, so an upload is never held twice in memory; a route that takes uploads keys its requests with the header.

Performance. An append writes its events in as few statements as the engines allow instead of one per event, which on PostgreSQL held the advisory lock for one round trip per event. The scheduled-command worker asks the store when the next command is due before claiming, so an idle pass is one indexed read rather than a write; `nextDueAt` is answered by two new partial indexes instead of a scan of the table, which the Durable Object ran after every command. The dead-letter index covers the order `list` sorts by. Events without personal fields are read without a copy or a promise each. A process instance carries the view that loaded it instead of the view keeping every stream id it ever loaded, which grew for the life of the app.

API. `Adapter.createStorage` takes no arguments: the `logger` it received was read by no adapter. `@bounda-dev/core/adapter/sql` exports `createSqlCheckpointStore` and `createSqlPersonalKeyStore`, the stores SQLite and PostgreSQL shared line for line, `insertEventsStatements` and `DEFAULT_TABLE_PREFIX`. An identifier over 63 characters, which PostgreSQL would cut in silence, is refused. The `GlobalStream` JSDoc says what the guide said: a personal field comes sealed.
