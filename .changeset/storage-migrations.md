Bounda versions its own tables and migrates them forward when the app starts, so a column or a table a new version needs reaches a database an earlier one created. A new table, `bounda_migrations`, records one row per migration applied, for each scope: `storage`, `checkpoints` (also where read models live in a database of their own) and `forget-ledger` (where the ledger lives). A database already at the latest version costs one read on start and takes no lock: on SQLite and the Durable Object that replaces the statements every start used to run. One that is behind is migrated under the database's lock, an advisory lock on the schema on PostgreSQL, the write transaction on SQLite and libSQL (waiting past the busy timeout while another process migrates), the object on a Durable Object, one transaction per migration that records its version as it commits: instances starting together migrate once, and a failed migration leaves the versions before it. Each table prefix and each Durable Object keeps its own versions.

A database that a newer version migrated is refused with `StorageSchemaTooNewError` (`STORAGE_SCHEMA_TOO_NEW`, with `scope`, `version` and `supported`), before anything is written: Bounda never takes a schema back. Tables from before 0.2.0 are refused with `ConfigurationError`.

The first migration takes in a database created before the tables were versioned, by any version from 0.2.0 on, with its rows. It adds the columns its tables lack, drops the superseded dead-letter status index and creates what is missing, and fills what the new columns would have held:

- On SQLite and the Durable Object, `bounda_person_rows` gets the references of every snapshot, remembered rejection, scheduled command and dead letter written before its triggers.
- A dead letter resolved before `resolved_at` existed counts as resolved at its last failure, the latest time known before it, so the retention never keeps it past its term.
- A dead letter written before errors were named gets `errorName` from the first line of its stack, `Error` without one, and its message and stack encoded as the store reads them. From such a database, `ProcessFailed` and `ScheduledCommandFailed` events name the error instead of quoting its text, and the inbox and scheduled commands drop the error text they kept in the clear.
- A `PersonalDataForgotten` event recorded before it named its person and reason names them, with `reason: "requested"`, the only one there was.

The app's own backfill still seals what was written before the personal data marks and fills `bounda_events.person` and the persons' activity, as before.

For adapter authors, `@bounda-dev/core/adapter/testing` gains `storageSchemaContract`, and a `SqliteConnection` may give `isBusy` so a migration waits for another process's.
