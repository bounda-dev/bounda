`forget` and the export no longer read every snapshot, remembered rejection, scheduled command and dead letter on SQLite and the Durable Object to find the ones that name a person: a new table, `bounda_person_rows`, records which row of those stores names which person, indexed by person, and triggers keep it in step with each row's `persons` in the statement that writes or removes the row, so a row's references are rewritten whenever its `persons` is. PostgreSQL already found them through the GIN index on `persons`.

`runtime.deadLetters.retention` bounds how long a dead letter is kept once retried or discarded: past it, the scheduled-command worker removes it, its error text and payload with it, a batch on each pass, and `nextDueAt()` names when the next one is due, so a Durable Object wakes for it. A `failed` letter is never removed, and no retention is set by default. A letter now records when it was resolved as `resolvedAt`, which `bounda dead-letters list` prints after its status. For adapter authors, `DeadLetterStore.updateStatus` takes the time of the change, and the store gains `firstResolvedAt()` and `purge({ resolvedBy, limit })`, which the storage contracts cover; the dead-letter table gains `resolved_at`, indexed. A process instance whose letter was discarded stays given up once the letter is removed.
