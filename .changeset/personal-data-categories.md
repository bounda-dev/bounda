Categories of personal data, each with its own key. `app/personal-data.ts` declares the categories with their legal basis (article 6 of the GDPR) and their retention, and `personal(schema, { category })` and `.personal({ category })` put a field in one; a field marked without one is in the default category, which behaves as every personal field did before. A misspelled category does not compile, and the app refuses to start on one.

- A person has a key per category. `forget(person)` forgets every category but those whose basis is `legal-obligation` while their retention runs: those are kept, restricted, and forgotten on their own when it ends. `forget(person, { categories })` forgets those alone, as when a consent is withdrawn; policies and processes take the same option.
- Each declared category is forgotten after its own retention, counted from the person's last activity; `runtime.personalData.retention` is the default category's, and forgets the person as a whole.
- `PersonalDataForgotten` gains `whole`, `categories`, `retained` and `expired`. The export names each field's category and every category's basis, retention and, for one kept, until when.
- Breaking for adapters: `PersonalKeyStore` keys by person and category (`get(person, category)`, `find`, `list`, `add(person, category, key)`, `remove(person, fingerprint)`, `retain`, `touch`, `listDue`, `holdDue`, `nextDueHoldEnd`), the snapshot, idempotency, scheduler and dead-letter stores' `forget` take the fingerprints to keep, `checkAppend` takes `keyOf`, `LoadResult.fingerprints` becomes `opened`, `StoredPerson` gains `position`, and forget ledger entries gain `categories`. The SQLite, PostgreSQL and Durable Object stores migrate their tables forward on start.
- CLI: `bounda forget <person> [--category <name>…]` and `bounda export <person>`; `bounda forgotten` lines carry `categories`.
