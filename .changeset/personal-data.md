Personal data in events, forgotten by crypto-shredding. An event's `payload` receives `personal` and `person` next to `z`: `personal(schema)` marks a field as personal data, stored encrypted (AES-256-GCM through WebCrypto, on Node and in `workerd`) with a key of the person the event names, `person(schema)` marks the field that names them, and without it the aggregate's id does. `app.forget(personId)`, on every `BoundaClient`, deletes the key and appends `PersonalDataForgotten` to the stream `bounda:<personId>`, in one transaction: from then on every personal field of theirs reads as `null`, typed `T | null` in every handler. A read model that projects an event with personal fields must handle it from `projections/bounda/personal-data-forgotten.ts`, which the generator checks in `.bounda/types.ts`; a policy may react to it from `policies/bounda/`. The adapters keep the keys, with their fingerprints, in a new `personal_keys` table, `Storage` and `StorageTransaction` gain `personalKeys`, and the storage contracts cover it. The global stream shows the fields as stored, encrypted. A command that loaded a person's data before `forget` and appends after it fails with `ConcurrencyError` and is decided again, instead of writing their data back under the new key another command may have given them meanwhile: the state remembers the key each person's data was read under, and `AppendArgs` gains `persons` (`{ person, fingerprint }`) for this, which a store ignores. Snapshots and remembered rejections name the same and are written only while that key is still the person's; in PostgreSQL a GIN index on their `persons` lets `forget` find them without reading every row.
