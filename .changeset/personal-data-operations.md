Operate the runtime's background work as one: share a lease, start over after a restore, and say where it stands.

- The backfill, the key rotation, the retention and the purge of resolved dead letters each run in one instance at a time, under a lease kept in `bounda_checkpoints`; an instance that stalls past it stops at its next item.
- A restored database is found and the background work starts over from it: the forget ledger is reconciled at once, the jobs forget what they knew, and the first instance clears the holds the copy brought back. Under the running app every instance finds it on its next pass, the `web` role through a watch of its own; restored while the app was stopped, the forget ledger's mark tells it at start, and without a ledger `bounda restored` (`app.restored()`) declares it. The generation behind it moves only after activity. `ForgetLedger.readMark`/`raiseMark` (forget-ledger migration 2), `PersonStore.releaseHolds`/`countIdle` and `PersonalKeyStore.releaseHolds`/`countWrappedUnder` are new (breaking for custom adapters and ledgers).
- Discarding a process dead letter ends its instance with `ProcessAbandoned` in the same transaction; `ProcessStatus` gains `"abandoned"`, and the purge of resolved letters no longer decides whether an instance was given up.
- Each subscriber's last failure is kept in `bounda_subscriber_failures` (storage migration 2), its text sealed under the person the event names whatever `runtime.telemetry.errorText` says. `app.subscriberFailures.list()`/`.get()` open it and are recorded in the access log (`subscriberFailures.list`, `subscriberFailures.get`); the export includes it as `subscriberFailures`. `Storage.subscriberFailures` is new (breaking for custom adapters), and `Delivery` failures carry the event and the error.
- `app.status()`, also on `connect` clients, reports the tables' versions by database, the restores found, every subscriber's lag and last failure without its text, and the backfill, ledger, rotation, retention and purge. `Adapter.schemaVersions()` and `Adapter.migrate(scopes)` are new (breaking for custom adapters), and `migrateTables({ config })` migrates every database a configuration names.
- `bounda status` prints it, with `--json`, and `--error-text` the failures' text through the recorded call; `bounda migrate` migrates the tables before a deploy, reading only the configuration; `bounda restored` declares a restore.
