The in-memory adapter, which `createTestApp` uses by default, now behaves as SQLite:

- Its tables keep rows as SQLite stores them. A date or a JSON value matches by value, `null` and `undefined` mean no value, a field patched with `undefined` is left alone, every read is a fresh copy, an update keeps each row in its place, and `orderBy` puts rows without a value first and text by code point.
- They refuse what SQLite refuses: a view with more than one primary key, a value a `unique()` field or the primary key already has (an update that would cause one changes no row), a required field left out (on an insert of a key already there too), an unknown field in `where`, a negative `limit` or `offset`.
- Its event, scheduler and dead-letter stores hand out payloads as JSON keeps them, fresh on every read, so a date comes back as its ISO string, and refuse one with no JSON, such as `undefined`. `appendAll` appends nothing when one payload is refused, and `append` returns the events it was given, as the SQL stores do.
- Dead letters list oldest failure first, then by id, and scheduled commands by `executeAt`, then by key, on every store. Ties break by code point; PostgreSQL uses `COLLATE "C"` for them instead of the database's collation.

`@bounda-dev/core/adapter/sql` exports `byExecuteAt`, the scheduler order.
