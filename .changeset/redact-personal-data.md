Rectification, article 16. `redact(personId, { events })` seals for good the fields named of the events named, each an event of the person's export, by `aggregateType`, `aggregateId`, `type` and `id`, with the `fields` marked `personal` to seal, typed per event type from the registry (`RedactOptions`, `RedactionTarget`, `RedactedFields`), the lifecycle events that carry a process's state included (`ProcessStateEventType`). In one transaction each value is opened under the person's key and sealed anew under a key made for the redaction and let go at once, so the field reads `null` from then on to every handler, upcaster, rebuild and the export; `PersonalDataRedacted` is appended to `bounda:<personId>` with the events, fields and categories it reached, never a value. The snapshots of those streams and the person's remembered rejections go, a scheduled command or a scheduled command's dead letter whose payload holds an old value goes, and an error text that quotes one is sealed for good. A field no key opens any more is left as it is, and nothing left to redact appends nothing. It is allowed while the person's processing is restricted. The export lists `redactions` and marks each event's `redacted` fields.

Every read model with personal fields writes `null` over each field of the person's rows that holds an old value, equal to it or quoting it, as it projects `PersonalDataRedacted`; the old values wait for that, sealed under the person's keys, in a scheduler entry the worker completes once every read model and every rebuild under way has passed the redaction, making unreadable then what work running at the redaction wrote of an old value after it, a subscriber's last failure included. `Scheduler.get(dedupeKey)` and `SubscriberFailureStore.reseal` are new on every engine. A rebuild keeps its progress from its start, so a redaction waits for it.

With a forget ledger a redaction is recorded before it commits (forget-ledger migration 6, `ForgetLedgerEntry.redaction`, `LedgerRedaction`) and redacted again by the reconciliation after a restore or a commit that never happened. `bounda redact <person> --from <file>` does it from the command line, the Durable Object and React Router's context forward it, and `expectRedacted` checks in a test that what a redaction made unreadable is read nowhere: every table as stored, every value a key still held opens, the logs, the spans and the forget ledger.
