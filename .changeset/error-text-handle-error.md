React Router apps no longer log the text of what a request throws unless the rule of `runtime.telemetry.errorText` says so. `createBounda`, from `@bounda-dev/react-router` and from `@bounda-dev/react-router/cloudflare`, and `@bounda-dev/react-router/app` return a `handleError` to export from `app/entry.server.tsx`, which React Router calls for what a loader, an action or the render throws, and which the render's `onError` calls too: it logs the method and the error's class and `code`, and its message, its stack and the request's path only with `"include"`, where React Router's default logs every message and stack, in production too. On Node it follows the booted app's configuration, the dev server's `"include"` before the app has booted, and writes to the console as `boot()` does (`logger` and `errorText` options of `createBounda`); on Cloudflare it follows `BOUNDA_ERROR_TEXT` in the Worker's `env`, or else the configuration, and writes JSON lines (`logger` option). It skips a request the client aborted and unwraps what React Router throws itself. The `bounda()` Vite plugin warns when the dev server or the build starts if `app/entry.server.*` is missing or exports no `handleError`.

The environment variable `BOUNDA_ERROR_TEXT` (`ERROR_TEXT_VARIABLE`), `"omit"` or `"include"`, overrides `runtime.telemetry.errorText`: `boot()` reads it once `.env` is loaded, the CLI reads it, below `--error-text`, and the Durable Object and the Worker of `@bounda-dev/cloudflare` read it from their `env`, so `.dev.vars` turns the text of errors on in development while a deployment keeps it out. `boot({ errorText })` and `bounda --error-text` still win; any other value fails with `ConfigurationError`. `errorTextFromEnv` reads it. `@bounda-dev/cloudflare` exports `workersLogger`, the logger its object and Worker default to.

Projects from `create-bounda` with React Router get `app/entry.server.tsx`, React Router's default entry for their runtime wired to Bounda's `handleError`; projects on Cloudflare get `BOUNDA_ERROR_TEXT=include` in `.dev.vars`, and a note in `.dev.vars.example` that keeps it out of what Deploy to Cloudflare asks for.
