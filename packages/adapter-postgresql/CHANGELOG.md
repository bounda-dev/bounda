# @bounda-dev/adapter-postgresql

## 0.1.0-alpha.7

### Patch Changes

- f660eb7: An app without policies or processes no longer runs a policy or process runner: nothing reads the
  log for them, nothing checkpoints and nothing wakes up. On Cloudflare that removes an alarm and
  two row writes after every command. A policy or process now always starts at the head of the log
  when it has no checkpoint yet, so adding the first one to a running app does not replay its
  history. `CheckpointStore` gains `remove(subscriber)`.
- f7ce38a: A read model rebuild can run in slices and resumes where it stopped. `rebuildReadModel` and
  `app.rebuildReadModel` take `maxEvents` and answer `done`; the position reached is saved after
  every batch, keyed by a fingerprint of the read model's fields and projections, so an interrupted
  `bounda rebuild` picks up where it was unless the code changed, and `app.pendingRebuilds()` lists
  what is waiting. On Cloudflare the Durable Object runs the first slice in the request and the
  rest in its alarm (`eventsPerRebuildSlice`, 5,000 by default). Adapters gain `resume` and
  `pause` in their rebuild.

## 0.1.0-alpha.6

### Patch Changes

- 176975a: Drive the runtime from a host without a background loop. `app.processUntilIdle({ maxPasses })`
  stops after that many rounds and resolves to `{ idle }`; `app.nextDueAt()` is the earliest moment
  a scheduled command or a process time-out becomes due. `Scheduler` gains `nextDueAt({ leaseMs })`,
  which counts the lease of a claimed command, in every adapter.
- 19dbca5: Show the Bounda wordmark at the top of each package's README, served from the documentation site so
  it renders on npm as well as on GitHub.

## 0.1.0-alpha.5

### Patch Changes

- 43f0f96: Advance checkpoints with `compareAndSet`. A dispatcher pass now moves a subscriber's checkpoint
  only from the position it read; when another process, a rebuild or an operator moved it meanwhile,
  the pass leaves their position alone and redelivers from there instead of overwriting it, which
  could skip events without a trace. `CheckpointStore` gains `compareAndSet(subscriber, expected,
  position)`; `set` stays for repositioning on purpose.
- 01642b8: Dead letters get a way out. `app.deadLetters` lists, counts, replays and discards the handler
  runs that gave up, and `bounda dead-letters list | replay <id> | discard <id>` does the same from
  the command line. A replay runs the failed policy or process handler again for its stored event,
  or dispatches the dropped scheduled command again; a process that had failed is back to `started`
  with its timeout re-armed at the original deadline. Command dead letters now record the command's
  payload, in a new nullable `payload` column the adapters add to existing databases on start.
- d8c06fa: `LISTEN`/`NOTIFY`. The PostgreSQL adapter ends every append's transaction with `pg_notify` on a
  channel named after the events table and exposes a notifier that `LISTEN`s on it; the dispatcher
  runs a pass the moment a notification arrives and, once passes stop finding events, polls only
  every `runtime.dispatcher.idleInterval` (30 seconds by default) as a safety net. A policy on
  PostgreSQL reacts in milliseconds and an idle worker barely touches the database. `StoragePorts`
  gains an optional `notifier`; SQLite has none and polls as before; the in-memory adapter notifies
  within the process.
- 78f9b01: Rebuild a read model without taking it offline. `bounda rebuild <read-model>` projects the whole
  stream into a fresh table with the view's current fields while queries keep reading the live one,
  then swaps the two in a single transaction and moves the read model's checkpoint to where the
  rebuild stopped; a worker that got further re-projects the difference. It is the path for a
  projection that had a bug and for a view that lost a field or changed a field's type, which the
  app still refuses to do on start, now naming the command. `rebuildReadModel` and
  `app.rebuildReadModel(name)` in `@bounda-dev/core`, `loadProject` in `@bounda-dev/core/node`,
  and `rebuildReadModel` in the adapter SPI; the in-memory adapter now shares one storage per
  instance so that a rebuild sees the same events as the app.

## 0.1.0-alpha.4

### Patch Changes

- 881e03d: Add the mutation score badge to each package's README, linked to its report on the Stryker
  dashboard.
- Updated dependencies [881e03d]
  - @bounda-dev/core@0.1.0-alpha.4

## 0.1.0-alpha.3

### Patch Changes

- 9e26090: Document installing without a dist-tag. While every published version is a prerelease, changesets
  publishes to `latest`, so `npm create bounda@alpha` resolved to an older alpha than a plain
  `npm create bounda`.

## 0.1.0-alpha.2

### Patch Changes

- @bounda-dev/core@0.1.0-alpha.2

## 0.1.0-alpha.1

### Minor Changes

- 2f9d007: First alpha.
  
  Bounda runs an event-sourced app from the files you write: aggregates, commands, events,
  policies, processes and read models under `app/domain` and `app/read`, wired by a generator that
  also writes every argument type. One database holds the events, the read models, the schedule and
  the dead letters.
  
  - `@bounda-dev/core`: the runtime. Commands append with optimistic concurrency, projections and
    policies run through a dispatcher with checkpoints and at-least-once delivery, processes are
    internal aggregates with time-outs, and queries compose. `boot()` for Node, `createTestApp()`
    for tests, an in-memory adapter and the ports to write your own.
  - `@bounda-dev/cli`: `bounda generate` reads the layout by file names alone and writes the
    registry, the types and a `+types` module next to every file. State is inferred from the `apply`
    functions when an aggregate has no `state.ts`.
  - `@bounda-dev/adapter-sqlite` and `@bounda-dev/adapter-postgresql`: storage on libSQL or
    PostgreSQL, safe for several processes on one database.
  - `@bounda-dev/react-router`: a Vite plugin and a middleware that boot the app once and hand it to
    every loader and action, reading its own writes by default.
  - `create-bounda`: `npm create bounda@alpha`, with a Node or a React Router project.
