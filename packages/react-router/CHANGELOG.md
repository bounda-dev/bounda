## 0.2.1

### Patch Changes

- f405d5d: The `bounda()` plugin writes the paths of the registry and the configuration into the server
  module with `/`, as Vite expects them on every platform, and recognises a change under
  `app/domain` or `app/read` whatever separator the watcher reports, so it behaves the same on
  Windows.

### Minor Changes

- c673958: On Cloudflare the host decides read-your-writes, as in React Router: `connect(stub, { consistency })`
  and `createWorker({ consistency })` take `"read-your-writes"`, the default and the behaviour so
  far, or `"eventual"`, under which a command answers once its events are stored and the object's
  alarm brings the read models up to date right after; any other value throws
  `ConfigurationError`. The `Consistency` type moves to
  `@bounda-dev/core`; `@bounda-dev/react-router` no longer exports it.
- dbc6876: One name per concept across the public API, the CLI and the stored rows.
  
  Breaking:
  
  - A dead letter is retried, not replayed: `app.deadLetters.replay(id)` is `retry(id)`, the status
    `replayed` is `retried`, and `bounda dead-letters replay <id>` is `bounda dead-letters retry <id>`.
    On Cloudflare, the client's `deadLetters.replay` is `deadLetters.retry` and the object's RPC
    method `replayDeadLetter` is `retryDeadLetter`. Replay is kept for reprocessing history.
  - "Subscriber" names only the group that keeps a checkpoint (`policies`, `processes`,
    `projection:<read model>`). The policy, process or scheduled command a dead letter or an inbox
    claim belongs to is its `handler`: `DeadLetter.subscriber` and the `subscriber` filter of
    `deadLetters.list` and `count` are `handler`, `bounda dead-letters list --subscriber` is
    `--handler`, `ClaimLostError.subscriber` is `handler`, and the `InboxLedger` store keys claims by
    `handler`. The `subscriber` column of the inbox and dead-letter tables is `handler`, and the
    `bounda.dead_letters` counter carries `bounda.handler` and `bounda.handler.kind` instead of
    `bounda.subscriber` and `bounda.subscriber.kind`, which stay on the dispatch span and the lag
    gauge.
  - A command dispatched with `delay` is a scheduled command everywhere: its dead letters have kind
    `scheduled` instead of `command` (`--kind scheduled` in the CLI and on the counter) and the
    command type as their `handler` instead of `scheduled:<CommandType>`, the event written when one
    fails for good is `ScheduledCommandFailed` instead of `CommandFailed`, and an invalid payload
    is reported for a "scheduled command".
  - `DeadLetterKind` no longer has `projection`: a projection never files a dead letter.
  - A dead letter that cannot be retried in the app as it now is (its policy, process or scheduled
    command is gone from the registry, its policy or process no longer handles the event, or its
    process instance failed on another step) is refused with the new `DeadLetterNotRetriableError`
    (code `DEAD_LETTER_NOT_RETRIABLE`) without running anything. A policy that no longer reacts to
    the letter's event used to run anyway, and a scheduled command that no longer exists was
    refused with `NotFoundError`.
  - `bounda dead-letters list` refuses a `--kind` or `--status` it does not know instead of listing
    nothing.
  - `consistency: "immediate"` in `@bounda-dev/react-router` is `consistency: "read-your-writes"`,
    still the default, and `createBounda` throws `ConfigurationError` for a value it does not know.
  - `processStreamId`, `ProcessStreamIdFunction` and `PROCESS_STREAM_PREFIX` are removed: nothing
    used them.
  - The storage no longer adds columns to tables an earlier version created, and
    `storageSchemaAdditions` is gone from `@bounda-dev/core/adapter/sqlite` and
    `@bounda-dev/sqlite`: a database created before this version has to be created again.
- 6245cf3: `react-router build` now bundles `bounda.config.ts` into the server build, next to the registry,
  and the built app reads `.env` from the directory it runs in. It used to keep the absolute path of
  the machine that built it, so a build deployed anywhere else answered every request with a 500,
  and it imported the configuration at runtime, so the file had to be shipped beside the build. In
  development an edited `bounda.config.ts` now reboots the app on the next request, and the
  generator runs once per build instead of once per environment.
  
  `boot()` and `loadProject()` take `importConfig`, a function that imports the configuration
  module after `.env` is loaded, for a bundler that has to see the import. `APP_MODULE_ID` is no
  longer exported from `@bounda-dev/react-router`.
- 9d6a57f: React Router runs on Cloudflare. With `storage: cloudflare()` and `@cloudflare/vite-plugin`, the
  `bounda()` plugin serves the app from the Worker: every loader and action reaches, through
  `connect`, the Durable Object of the tenant that `app/tenant.ts` names, with the plugin's
  `consistency`. Without that file the first request fails saying what to create.
  `@bounda-dev/react-router/cloudflare` exports `createBounda({ config, tenant })` and
  `TenantFunction` for a server module of your own.
  
  Breaking:
  
  - `createWorker` takes the configuration instead of a binding, and `tenantOf` is required:
    `createWorker({ config, tenantOf })`. The binding is `cloudflare({ binding })`, `"STORE"` by
    default, and the `x-bounda-tenant` header is no longer a default tenant: the Cloudflare project
    from `create-bounda` passes it as `tenantOf`.
  - `@bounda-dev/core` exports `BoundaClient`, what a request sees of an app wherever it runs, and
    `BoundaApp` extends it. `connect` returns one and `@bounda-dev/cloudflare` no longer
    exports its own; the `bounda` context of `@bounda-dev/react-router` holds one too, so a loader
    reaches `commands`, `queries`, `getLag()`, `deadLetters` and `rebuildReadModel`, but not the
    rest of `BoundaApp`.
  
  Also:
  
  - `@bounda-dev/core` exports `checkConsistency`, which throws `ConfigurationError` for a
    `consistency` other than `"read-your-writes"` or `"eventual"`: the check `createBounda`,
    `connect` and `createWorker` make, now in one place.
  - `failure()` goes by the error's `code`, so it answers the refusals a Durable Object sends back,
    which arrive as plain errors, as it answers a `ValidationError` or a `DomainError`.
  - `createBounda` from `@bounda-dev/react-router` imports `@bounda-dev/core/node` only when it boots.
  - Under the `bounda()` plugin in Node, a configuration that imports the Workers runtime, as
    `cloudflare()` does, fails the boot with a `ConfigurationError` that says to add
    `@cloudflare/vite-plugin`.

### Patch Changes

- 64bf5d9: `failure` from `@bounda-dev/react-router/app` turns what a command throws into an action's answer:
  a `ValidationError` becomes a 400 with its `issues`, a `DomainError` a 409 with its code in
  `rejected`, and anything else is rethrown for the route's `ErrorBoundary`. Return it from the
  action's `catch`. `Failure`, the shape of that data, is exported from `@bounda-dev/react-router`.
  A React Router project from `create-bounda` imports `failure` instead of carrying its own copy in
  `app/errors.server.ts`, which it no longer has.
- a77e479: Tighten the JSDoc of the public API to what it guarantees, and correct the comments that no longer matched the code: `boundaMiddleware` is mounted with `export const middleware = [boundaMiddleware]`, `schemaVersion` follows the event's upcasts, and a superseded rebuild's abort does nothing.
- 04e643b: `@bounda-dev/cloudflare` no longer exports `ConfigForObjectFunction`, the type of a
  function it never exported. The `createBounda` example and the React Router README no longer call
  a `payloadOf` helper that does not exist, and the `DomainError` JSDoc says what it does in a policy
  or a process: it is terminal, and the run is dead-lettered at once.

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 774e68e: The first release out of alpha. Everything the alphas shipped is in, and from here the API changes
  only between minor versions, with every change that breaks something called out in this
  changelog, until 1.0.
  
  Bounda 0.1 is event sourcing and CQRS for TypeScript on one database: modules that export functions
  under `app/domain` and `app/read`, with every type generated by `bounda generate`; commands with
  optimistic concurrency; policies and processes that run once per event, with retries and dead
  letters; scheduled commands; read models whose projections apply every event exactly once and
  spread over instances, rebuilt without going offline; read-your-writes; SQLite, libSQL,
  PostgreSQL or one Cloudflare Durable Object per store; OpenTelemetry spans and metrics; a React
  Router integration and `create-bounda`. The alpha entries below have the details.

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [774e68e]
  - @bounda-dev/core@0.1.0
  - @bounda-dev/cli@0.1.0

  - @bounda-dev/core@0.1.0-alpha.9
  - @bounda-dev/cli@0.1.0-alpha.9

## 0.1.0-alpha.8

### Patch Changes

- 312cc35: When `createBounda` is called again in development, the next request boots the new app only once
  the one booted before has stopped. It used to boot at once while the previous app was still
  closing, so for a moment both held the storage. `dispose()` now resolves once every app booted
  under its key has stopped, including one a later `createBounda` is still stopping.
- 312cc35: Closing the dev server now waits for a regeneration the `bounda()` Vite plugin is running, and
  drops one still waiting for its quiet time. It used to let both go on, so the generator could
  write to the project after the server had closed.

## 0.1.0-alpha.6

### Patch Changes

- 19dbca5: Show the Bounda wordmark at the top of each package's README, served from the documentation site so
  it renders on npm as well as on GitHub.

## 0.1.0-alpha.5

### Patch Changes

- 9be9de3: Document `npm create bounda@latest`. Without the tag, npx can reuse a `create-bounda` it cached
  earlier, and that older scaffolder pins the Bounda packages to the version it shipped with.

## 0.1.0-alpha.4

### Patch Changes

- 881e03d: Add the mutation score badge to each package's README, linked to its report on the Stryker
  dashboard.
- Updated dependencies [881e03d]
  - @bounda-dev/core@0.1.0-alpha.4
  - @bounda-dev/cli@0.1.0-alpha.4

## 0.1.0-alpha.3

### Patch Changes

- 9e26090: Document installing without a dist-tag. While every published version is a prerelease, changesets
  publishes to `latest`, so `npm create bounda@alpha` resolved to an older alpha than a plain
  `npm create bounda`.
- Updated dependencies [9e26090]
  - @bounda-dev/core@0.1.0-alpha.3
  - @bounda-dev/cli@0.1.0-alpha.3

## 0.1.0-alpha.2

### Patch Changes

- 3e75b91: Keep the package out of Vite's server externals so the `bounda()` plugin serves
  `@bounda-dev/react-router/app` when the package is installed from a registry. Vite matches
  `noExternal` against the package, not the subpath, so a pattern for the subpath alone left the
  real module to be loaded by Node, and every request failed with the "served by the bounda() Vite
  plugin" error. A workspace link is never externalised, which is why the examples in this
  repository worked.
- @bounda-dev/cli@0.1.0-alpha.2
  - @bounda-dev/core@0.1.0-alpha.2

## 0.1.0-alpha.1

### Minor Changes

- 2f9d007: First alpha.
  
  Bounda runs an event-sourced app from the files you write: aggregates, commands, events,
  policies, processes and read models under `app/domain` and `app/read`, wired by a generator that
  also writes every argument type. One database holds the events, the read models, the schedule and
  the dead letters.
  
  - `@bounda-dev/core`: the runtime. Commands append with optimistic concurrency, projections and
    policies run through a dispatcher with checkpoints and at-least-once delivery, processes are
    internal aggregates with time-outs, and queries compose. `boot()` for Node, `createTestApp()`
    for tests, an in-memory adapter and the ports to write your own.
  - `@bounda-dev/cli`: `bounda generate` reads the layout by file names alone and writes the
    registry, the types and a `+types` module next to every file. State is inferred from the `apply`
    functions when an aggregate has no `state.ts`.
  - `@bounda-dev/adapter-sqlite` and `@bounda-dev/adapter-postgresql`: storage on libSQL or
    PostgreSQL, safe for several processes on one database.
  - `@bounda-dev/react-router`: a Vite plugin and a middleware that boot the app once and hand it to
    every loader and action, reading its own writes by default.
  - `create-bounda`: `npm create bounda@alpha`, with a Node or a React Router project.
