# @bounda-dev/core

## 0.1.0-alpha.6

### Patch Changes

- 176975a: Drive the runtime from a host without a background loop. `app.processUntilIdle({ maxPasses })`
  stops after that many rounds and resolves to `{ idle }`; `app.nextDueAt()` is the earliest moment
  a scheduled command or a process time-out becomes due. `Scheduler` gains `nextDueAt({ leaseMs })`,
  which counts the lease of a claimed command, in every adapter.
- 19dbca5: Show the Bounda wordmark at the top of each package's README, served from the documentation site so
  it renders on npm as well as on GitHub.
- 5000433: The SQLite stores, the storage schema and the read models move from `@bounda-dev/adapter-sqlite`
  into `@bounda-dev/core/adapter/sqlite`, behind a `SqlDatabase` interface and a
  `createSqliteAdapter` factory that builds a complete adapter from any SQLite connection.
  `@bounda-dev/adapter-sqlite` now only brings the libSQL connection, and keeps exporting the schema
  helpers it did before. Nothing changes for an app.

## 0.1.0-alpha.5

### Patch Changes

- 43f0f96: Advance checkpoints with `compareAndSet`. A dispatcher pass now moves a subscriber's checkpoint
  only from the position it read; when another process, a rebuild or an operator moved it meanwhile,
  the pass leaves their position alone and redelivers from there instead of overwriting it, which
  could skip events without a trace. `CheckpointStore` gains `compareAndSet(subscriber, expected,
  position)`; `set` stays for repositioning on purpose.
- 01642b8: Dead letters get a way out. `app.deadLetters` lists, counts, replays and discards the handler
  runs that gave up, and `bounda dead-letters list | replay <id> | discard <id>` does the same from
  the command line. A replay runs the failed policy or process handler again for its stored event,
  or dispatches the dropped scheduled command again; a process that had failed is back to `started`
  with its timeout re-armed at the original deadline. Command dead letters now record the command's
  payload, in a new nullable `payload` column the adapters add to existing databases on start.
- d8c06fa: `LISTEN`/`NOTIFY`. The PostgreSQL adapter ends every append's transaction with `pg_notify` on a
  channel named after the events table and exposes a notifier that `LISTEN`s on it; the dispatcher
  runs a pass the moment a notification arrives and, once passes stop finding events, polls only
  every `runtime.dispatcher.idleInterval` (30 seconds by default) as a safety net. A policy on
  PostgreSQL reacts in milliseconds and an idle worker barely touches the database. `StoragePorts`
  gains an optional `notifier`; SQLite has none and polls as before; the in-memory adapter notifies
  within the process.
- 02e45fd: OpenTelemetry. `@bounda-dev/core` depends on `@opentelemetry/api` and instruments the runtime:
  spans for every command dispatch, every batch the dispatcher hands to a subscriber, every
  projection, policy and process handler run, and every scheduled command the worker executes, all
  carrying `bounda.correlation_id`; an observable gauge `bounda.dispatcher.lag` per subscriber and
  counters `bounda.commands` and `bounda.dead_letters`. Without an SDK registered the API is a
  no-op; register one before `boot()` and everything shows up under the scope `@bounda-dev/core`.
- 789ac78: The README says what the runtime offers an app in production and points at the one list of what
  is not there yet.
- 78f9b01: Rebuild a read model without taking it offline. `bounda rebuild <read-model>` projects the whole
  stream into a fresh table with the view's current fields while queries keep reading the live one,
  then swaps the two in a single transaction and moves the read model's checkpoint to where the
  rebuild stopped; a worker that got further re-projects the difference. It is the path for a
  projection that had a bug and for a view that lost a field or changed a field's type, which the
  app still refuses to do on start, now naming the command. `rebuildReadModel` and
  `app.rebuildReadModel(name)` in `@bounda-dev/core`, `loadProject` in `@bounda-dev/core/node`,
  and `rebuildReadModel` in the adapter SPI; the in-memory adapter now shares one storage per
  instance so that a rebuild sees the same events as the app.
- 138ac4a: Upcasts. When an event's payload changes shape after events are stored, `<event>.upcast.ts`
  next to the event exports `upcasts`: one function per past version, oldest first, the last one
  producing today's payload, which `Event.Upcasts` from the event's `+types` checks. The runtime
  stamps new events with `schemaVersion = upcasts.length + 1` and, on every read, applies the
  upcasts from the stored version on, so `apply`, policies, processes, projections and rebuilds only
  ever see the current shape. An event written with a version the running code does not know is
  refused. The generator recognises the module and emits it under `upcasts` in the registry.

## 0.1.0-alpha.4

### Patch Changes

- 881e03d: Add the mutation score badge to each package's README, linked to its report on the Stryker
  dashboard.

## 0.1.0-alpha.3

### Patch Changes

- 9e26090: Document installing without a dist-tag. While every published version is a prerelease, changesets
  publishes to `latest`, so `npm create bounda@alpha` resolved to an older alpha than a plain
  `npm create bounda`.

## 0.1.0-alpha.2

No changes in this release.

## 0.1.0-alpha.1

### Minor Changes

- 2f9d007: First alpha.
  
  Bounda runs an event-sourced app from the files you write: aggregates, commands, events,
  policies, processes and read models under `app/domain` and `app/read`, wired by a generator that
  also writes every argument type. One database holds the events, the read models, the schedule and
  the dead letters.
  
  - `@bounda-dev/core`: the runtime. Commands append with optimistic concurrency, projections and
    policies run through a dispatcher with checkpoints and at-least-once delivery, processes are
    internal aggregates with time-outs, and queries compose. `boot()` for Node, `createTestApp()`
    for tests, an in-memory adapter and the ports to write your own.
  - `@bounda-dev/cli`: `bounda generate` reads the layout by file names alone and writes the
    registry, the types and a `+types` module next to every file. State is inferred from the `apply`
    functions when an aggregate has no `state.ts`.
  - `@bounda-dev/adapter-sqlite` and `@bounda-dev/adapter-postgresql`: storage on libSQL or
    PostgreSQL, safe for several processes on one database.
  - `@bounda-dev/react-router`: a Vite plugin and a middleware that boot the app once and hand it to
    every loader and action, reading its own writes by default.
  - `create-bounda`: `npm create bounda@alpha`, with a Node or a React Router project.
