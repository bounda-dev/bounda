## 0.1.0-alpha.8

### Minor Changes

- 2083e68: Projections apply every event exactly once, with any number of instances. Each batch now runs in
  one transaction on the read model's database that writes the rows and advances the checkpoint
  together, holding a lock named after the read model: `pg_advisory_xact_lock` on PostgreSQL, the
  single writer on SQLite and libSQL, the storage transaction in a Durable Object. Two bugs are gone
  with it: an instance that fell behind could apply an old batch over rows a faster instance had
  already moved past, leaving them wrong with no lag to show for it, and a batch redelivered after a
  projection threw halfway applied its first events twice, which counted twice in a projection that
  reads a row to update it. Background passes skip a read model another instance holds, so read
  models spread over the workers; `processUntilIdle`, `catchUpReadModels` and read-your-writes wait
  for it. Inside a batch, a projection's `client.raw` is the driver's transaction handle.
  
  A batch keeps its transaction open for at most the new `runtime.dispatcher.projectionBatchTime`,
  250 ms by default, and commits what it got through when it runs out.
  
  Rebuilds are exact too: every batch commits with its progress, so an interrupted rebuild resumes
  without projecting anything twice, and the swap sets the read model's checkpoint to the rebuilt
  position under the projection lock instead of only moving it back.
  
  A read model configured on a database of its own keeps its checkpoint and its rebuild progress in
  that database.
  
  Breaking for adapter authors: `ReadModelPorts` gains `checkpointStore` and `transact`;
  `ReadModelRebuild` gains `position`, `checkpointStore` and `transact`, and `commit` takes the
  subscriber and position; `CreateReadModelRebuildArgs` takes `progress` instead of `resume`;
  `SqlDatabase.write` hands its work a `SqlTransaction` that carries the driver's `raw` handle.
- 5d81066: Two rebuilds of the same read model no longer write at once. They used to share the shadow table
  and its progress, so the second could drop the table the first was filling, and either could swap
  in rows the other had half written. Opening a rebuild now claims the next generation of that read
  model under a lock, and every batch, the commit and the abort go ahead only while that generation
  is still the latest: the rebuild started last takes over, resuming where the other got when the
  code is the same, and the older one stops at its next step with the new `RebuildSupersededError`
  (`REBUILD_SUPERSEDED`) without writing or dropping anything. A rebuild whose process died needs no
  timeout to be replaced. `rebuildFencing` in `@bounda-dev/core/adapter` names the lock and the
  generation checkpoint for adapter authors.
  
  On Cloudflare, an alarm slice that another rebuild took over is logged at `info` as
  `bounda rebuild slice taken over by another rebuild` instead of as a failed slice, and is not
  retried as one: the rebuild that took over carries on.

## 0.1.0-alpha.6

### Patch Changes

- 176975a: Drive the runtime from a host without a background loop. `app.processUntilIdle({ maxPasses })`
  stops after that many rounds and resolves to `{ idle }`; `app.nextDueAt()` is the earliest moment
  a scheduled command or a process time-out becomes due. `Scheduler` gains `nextDueAt({ leaseMs })`,
  which counts the lease of a claimed command, in every adapter.
- 19dbca5: Show the Bounda wordmark at the top of each package's README, served from the documentation site so
  it renders on npm as well as on GitHub.
- 5000433: The SQLite stores, the storage schema and the read models move from `@bounda-dev/adapter-sqlite`
  into `@bounda-dev/core/adapter/sqlite`, behind a `SqlDatabase` interface and a
  `createSqliteAdapter` factory that builds a complete adapter from any SQLite connection.
  `@bounda-dev/adapter-sqlite` now only brings the libSQL connection, and keeps exporting the schema
  helpers it did before. Nothing changes for an app.

## 0.1.0-alpha.5

### Patch Changes

- 43f0f96: Advance checkpoints with `compareAndSet`. A dispatcher pass now moves a subscriber's checkpoint
  only from the position it read; when another process, a rebuild or an operator moved it meanwhile,
  the pass leaves their position alone and redelivers from there instead of overwriting it, which
  could skip events without a trace. `CheckpointStore` gains `compareAndSet(subscriber, expected,
  position)`; `set` stays for repositioning on purpose.
- 01642b8: Dead letters get a way out. `app.deadLetters` lists, counts, replays and discards the handler
  runs that gave up, and `bounda dead-letters list | replay <id> | discard <id>` does the same from
  the command line. A replay runs the failed policy or process handler again for its stored event,
  or dispatches the dropped scheduled command again; a process that had failed is back to `started`
  with its timeout re-armed at the original deadline. Command dead letters now record the command's
  payload, in a new nullable `payload` column the adapters add to existing databases on start.
- 78f9b01: Rebuild a read model without taking it offline. `bounda rebuild <read-model>` projects the whole
  stream into a fresh table with the view's current fields while queries keep reading the live one,
  then swaps the two in a single transaction and moves the read model's checkpoint to where the
  rebuild stopped; a worker that got further re-projects the difference. It is the path for a
  projection that had a bug and for a view that lost a field or changed a field's type, which the
  app still refuses to do on start, now naming the command. `rebuildReadModel` and
  `app.rebuildReadModel(name)` in `@bounda-dev/core`, `loadProject` in `@bounda-dev/core/node`,
  and `rebuildReadModel` in the adapter SPI; the in-memory adapter now shares one storage per
  instance so that a rebuild sees the same events as the app.

## 0.1.0-alpha.4

### Patch Changes

- 881e03d: Add the mutation score badge to each package's README, linked to its report on the Stryker
  dashboard.
- Updated dependencies [881e03d]
  - @bounda-dev/core@0.1.0-alpha.4

## 0.1.0-alpha.3

### Patch Changes

- 9e26090: Document installing without a dist-tag. While every published version is a prerelease, changesets
  publishes to `latest`, so `npm create bounda@alpha` resolved to an older alpha than a plain
  `npm create bounda`.

## 0.1.0-alpha.2

### Patch Changes

## 0.1.0-alpha.1

### Minor Changes

- 2f9d007: First alpha.
  
  Bounda runs an event-sourced app from the files you write: aggregates, commands, events,
  policies, processes and read models under `app/domain` and `app/read`, wired by a generator that
  also writes every argument type. One database holds the events, the read models, the schedule and
  the dead letters.
  
  - `@bounda-dev/core`: the runtime. Commands append with optimistic concurrency, projections and
    policies run through a dispatcher with checkpoints and at-least-once delivery, processes are
    internal aggregates with time-outs, and queries compose. `boot()` for Node, `createTestApp()`
    for tests, an in-memory adapter and the ports to write your own.
  - `@bounda-dev/cli`: `bounda generate` reads the layout by file names alone and writes the
    registry, the types and a `+types` module next to every file. State is inferred from the `apply`
    functions when an aggregate has no `state.ts`.
  - `@bounda-dev/adapter-sqlite` and `@bounda-dev/adapter-postgresql`: storage on libSQL or
    PostgreSQL, safe for several processes on one database.
  - `@bounda-dev/react-router`: a Vite plugin and a middleware that boot the app once and hand it to
    every loader and action, reading its own writes by default.
  - `create-bounda`: `npm create bounda@alpha`, with a Node or a React Router project.
