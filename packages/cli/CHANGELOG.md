# @bounda-dev/cli

## 0.2.2

### Patch Changes

- 572fd06: State inference lists a member once when more than one event gives it to a field: a `begin` that
  sets `chargeId: null as string | null` and an `evolve` that sets a `string` type it as
  `string | null`, no longer `string | string | null`. `boolean` and enums stay whole. A function
  type one event gives a field next to another event's type keeps its parentheses,
  `(() => void) | null`, where it came out as `() => void | null`, a function that returns
  `void | null`; an intersection takes them too.
- Updated dependencies [5a5d5c4]

## 0.2.1

### Patch Changes

- efeb59a: State inference types a field an `evolve` computes from the state, such as
  `reminders: state.reminders + 1` or `waiting: [...state.waiting, id]`, from what the other events
  set: it used to come out as `any`, without a warning. A field that only ever comes from itself, with
  nothing to give it a type, or a chain of them that does not settle after a few passes, is typed as
  `unknown`, and `bounda generate` warns about it.
- @bounda-dev/core@0.2.1

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- c3ded62: The event that opens an aggregate can export `begin({ event })` instead of `evolve`: it gets the
  event alone and returns the fields the aggregate starts with. When one of an aggregate's events
  exports `begin`, the inferred state tells a command handler whether the aggregate exists: before
  its first event every field is `undefined`, and after it the fields every `begin` sets are always
  defined, so a handler that checks `state.status` reads the rest without `?`. The generator writes
  that as `OrderState = core.NotCreated<OrderCreatedState> | OrderCreatedState`, and `evolve`, which
  only runs on an aggregate that exists, gets `OrderCreatedState`. An aggregate with no `begin`
  keeps the state it had, every field optional. The `+types` of every event gain `BeginArgs`.
  
  What `begin` and `evolve` return is merged shallowly over the state, as a process handler's result
  already is: an event returns only the fields it sets, and `{ ...state, x }` still works. A field
  returned as `undefined` now keeps its value; clear one with `null`. An `evolve` that returns
  anything but an object or nothing fails the fold.
  
  An aggregate with a `begin` starts with such an event. A command that would start it with another
  event, or put an event that only exports `begin` on an aggregate that exists, throws the new
  `CreationOrderError` and stores nothing; a reaction does not retry it. A stream written before
  `begin` existed still loads, with a warning. The project from `create-bounda` opens its order with
  `begin` and no longer has a `state.ts`.
- 5e22e02: The root of an aggregate holds more than its events. A module there is an event when it exports
  `payload`, `begin` or `evolve` and nothing else at run time; a port when `infrastructure/` holds a
  directory named after it; and anything else, a value object, a domain service or a helper, file
  or directory, is left to the handlers that import it, with no `_` in front. A module that exports
  an event's function next to anything else is reported, and `bounda generate` warns about a module
  that imports its own `+types` without exporting an event's function (an event that lost its
  `evolve` to a typo or still exports `apply`) and about a directory one letter away from one it
  reads, or named `command`, `policy`, `process` or `infra`, whose modules would go unregistered.
  
  Breaking: a read model can no longer share its name with an aggregate, since the configuration
  groups ports by module name. `report.warnings` from `generate` holds both kinds as
  `GenerateWarning`, `{ module, message }`, instead of the inference warning's `aggregate`.
- fc92bad: An event of another aggregate that a process listens to reaches the instance its payload's id
  field names, the field named after the process's aggregate (`orderId` for an `order` process, or
  the `aggregateId` of its `state.ts`), with nothing to declare; a `null` there belongs to no
  instance. Boot reads the field from the event's schema, a plain `z.object` (behind a
  `.transform()` what is stored cannot be read), and still refuses an event that has neither the
  field nor a `correlate` entry, saying which.
  
  `correlate` is now a function, like `config` and `state`: it gets `from` and returns
  `from.<aggregate>.<Event>((event) => …)` for each event it decides, with `event` typed without
  annotating anything. It overrides the id field. The `+types` of a process `index.ts` give
  `CorrelateArgs` instead of `Correlate`; `ProcessCorrelate` is replaced by `ProcessCorrelateArgs`
  and `ProcessCorrelation`. Boot refuses a `correlate` that is not a function, that does not return
  such a list, that names an event twice or that throws.
- efcd4fb: A command declares how it may say no. Its module exports `rejections`, a function of the command
  and the state the handler saw to `{ Code: message }`, and its handler returns `reject("Code")`, or
  throws it: `reject` is in the handler's arguments only when the module exports `rejections`, and it
  only takes those codes. It returns the `DomainError` the caller gets, which now carries the code in
  `rejected`. A `DomainError` can no longer be built with `new`: its constructor takes a `Rejection`
  only `reject` makes. The `+types` of every command gain `RejectionsArgs`.
  
  In a policy or a process, `await commands.x()` resolves with the rejection instead of throwing it:
  `rejected` is `false` when the aggregate decided, or the code, typed by what the command declares,
  with its `message`, so compensating is `if (paid.rejected === "NotOpen")`, without `try/catch`. A
  rejection the handler does not look at changes nothing and the run goes on; it is logged and
  recorded on the command's span as the event `bounda.command.rejected`. Before, it failed the run
  for good. A scheduled command that is rejected when it runs is no longer dead-lettered either, nor
  recorded as `ScheduledCommandFailed`. The promise rejects only for a failure. Only what the command's own
  `reject` made is a rejection: a `DomainError` from anywhere else, such as another app's command,
  fails the command. A policy or process can no longer throw a `DomainError` to give up at once.
  `runUntilIdle()` returns the rejections that happened while it ran, in `rejections`, for tests to
  assert the ones they expect.
  
  A policy or process run now waits for every command it dispatched before it commits, awaited or
  not, within its time limit, and one that fails fails the run, even when the handler caught its
  error; one the handler withdrew with its own signal does not. Before, a command the handler did not
  await could be left out of the run, and its failure ended Node with an unhandled rejection.
  `bounda generate` refuses a port named `reject`.
  
  `app.commands` still throws the rejection, now with `rejected`. The `bounda.commands` counter
  counts a failure as `failed`, apart from a rejection. The Cloudflare worker's 409 and the error
  `connect` throws carry `rejected`, as does what `failure` from `@bounda-dev/react-router/app`
  answers in a React Router project from `create-bounda`, whose order rejects a second placement
  with `AlreadyPlaced`.
- 5e22e02: An event folds into its aggregate's state through `evolve`, the name the Decider pattern gives that
  function, and the event that opens the aggregate exports `begin`. `create` and `apply` are common
  names for a factory or a domain service, so they stay free for the modules that sit next to the
  events.
  
  Breaking: rename `apply` to `evolve` in every event. `Event.ApplyArgs` becomes `Event.EvolveArgs`,
  and `EventApplyArgs` becomes `EventEvolveArgs`. Run
  `bounda generate` to update generated files.
- 5fa2add: Fixes from a review of the generator, the registry checks and the CLI:
  
  - A policy that exports no `on` reacts to the longest event of its aggregate that its key ends with after `On`, by one rule core exports as `policyTrigger` and `bounda generate` uses too. `put-on-hold-on-payment-failed` used to compile with one event and fail to boot with another, and every policy for an aggregate named `add-on` failed to boot. A policy that exports `on` is typed with any event of its aggregate, and `bounda generate` warns about one that exports no `on` and whose name gives no event, which boot refuses.
  - Boot refuses a projection whose event, from its file name or its `on`, its aggregate does not have, as it already did for policies; `bounda generate` warns about such a file that exports no `on`.
  - `bounda generate` refuses two commands, or two queries, with the same key across the app, and an aggregate or read model whose generated types meet others (`test`, `order-created` next to `order`). A module named like a reserved word (`delete`, `import`), `registry`, or like another of its owner no longer produces a registry that does not parse.
  - State inference reads `begin` and `evolve` exported in a list (`export { evolve }`), and downgrades a field whose type is not visible on any of its lines.
  - Boot refuses `readModels` and `runtime.overrides` keys the registry does not have, and `payload`, `repository`, `state` or `correlate` exports that are not functions.
  - `rootDir` is gone from the configuration: nothing read it.
  - `bounda generate --watch` ignores `.bounda` as well as `+types`, and no longer prints that it is watching after the watch failed. Ctrl+C stops every other command at once. `dead-letters list --limit` takes only a whole number, 0 or more.
  - Generated files and read-model fingerprints are ordered by code unit, the same on every machine.
  - With state to infer, `bounda generate` no longer writes `.bounda/types.ts` with every state unknown and then again inferred: TypeScript reads the first pass from memory, so the file is written once, or not at all when nothing changed, and editors and `tsc --watch` never see the intermediate one.
- c21ab25: Events that reach a failed process instance are no longer dropped. Each one that would do
  something in it (it has a handler, or completes the process) is parked in the instance's stream as
  `ProcessEventParked`, in the order it arrived, and nothing of the process runs meanwhile, its
  deadlines included. Retrying the dead letter of the failure runs the failed handler, then handles
  the parked events in order with the `idempotencyKey` each would have had, and only then records
  `ProcessResumed`, puts the instance back to `started` and schedules its deadlines again. An event
  that arrives during the retry is parked and handled before the instance resumes, so nothing
  overtakes an older one, and a deadline that came due before a parked event arrived runs before
  it. A parked event that fails again becomes the new dead letter at once, with the rest still
  parked behind it. Discarding the letter gives the instance up: it stays failed, its parked
  events never run and later ones are dropped. `ProcessFailed` now carries its dead letter, which is
  filed again the next time the instance is reached if writing it was cut short.
  
  A process that holds an event for a retry is no longer handed the later events of the same
  batch, so none of them overtakes it, as the guide already promised.
  
  `app.deadLetters` fills in `parked` on process letters, how many events wait behind the failure,
  and `bounda dead-letters list` prints it; on the letter a retry returns, it counts what still
  waits because the process failed again, and `bounda dead-letters retry` says so. A failure whose
  handler a deploy removed is let through on retry.
  
  Breaking, for code that reads process streams: a failed instance is back to `started` only on
  `ProcessResumed`, no longer on the `ProcessHandled` or `ProcessDeadlineReached` a retry writes,
  and `ProcessFailed` for a deadline records its moment as `at`. A failure recorded by an earlier
  version, whose `ProcessFailed` carries no dead letter, cannot be retried through `app.deadLetters`.
- ba8539d: A policy attempt writes everything or nothing. The commands a policy handler dispatches are
  decided on the spot, but their events, its scheduled commands and the inbox claim that marks the
  event done are written together, in one transaction of the store, when the attempt ends; when
  the runtime gives up, the dead letter goes in the same transaction. A handler that throws, runs
  out of time or dies before that leaves no command behind, immediate or scheduled, and the next
  attempt decides afresh; a commit that finds a stream moved runs the attempt again on the new
  state without spending an attempt. Live policies and delayed policy runs get this now; process
  steps follow in the next change.
  
  What `await commands.x()` resolves with inside a policy or process handler is now a
  `ReactionDispatchResult`: the aggregate's decision, without `position`, since nothing is stored
  until the attempt commits. `bounda generate` emits it as `ReactionCommands`; run it to update
  generated files.
  
  For adapter authors, the `InboxLedger` store changes: `tryClaim` returns the claim's id (or
  `null`), `ClaimRecord` carries `claimId`, and `complete` and `fail` accept a `claimId` to settle
  only while the claim is still that one, rejecting with `ClaimLostError` otherwise. The SQLite and
  PostgreSQL inbox tables gain a `claim_id` column.
- 247a8e6: A process can listen to other aggregates. Its `config` receives every event of the app by
  aggregate, `events.payment.PaymentFailed`, so another aggregate's event can start, feed or complete
  it, and a handler for one sits in a folder named after that aggregate,
  `processes/<process>/payment/on-payment-failed.ts`. Such an event carries its own aggregate's id,
  so it finds its instance through the id field of its payload or through the process's
  `correlate` (see the entry on correlating by convention). The process's own events still find
  their instance by `aggregateId`. A correlator that throws, or returns anything but a non-empty
  string or `null`, dead-letters that event for the process instead of stopping every process at it.
  
  An event that does not start the process and finds no open instance is skipped, as is any event
  for an instance that completed, timed out or failed; a starting event never reopens one. The state
  a handler returns is now parsed with the process's `state` schema (defaults filled, undeclared keys
  dropped), and a state it refuses fails the handler for good. A dead-letter retry finds the instance through `correlate` too.
  
  Breaking: process configs name events as `events.<aggregate>.<Event>`; run `bounda generate`. A
  hand-written registry groups process handlers by aggregate (`handlers.order.orderPaid`).
- 6c504e1: Processes have deadlines, and a deadline is state. A field of a process `state` declared with
  `deadline()` is a moment the process acts at: a handler schedules it by setting it with
  `after("24h")`, moves it by changing it and cancels it with `null`, and `at-<field>.ts` runs when
  it comes due (`nextReminder` runs `at-next-reminder.ts`). `instant()` declares a moment the process
  only records. Both are `Instant`s, ISO 8601 strings in UTC; `asInstant` makes one for a test.
  `after()`, which every process handler now receives, counts from what triggered the handler, the
  event's time or the moment that came due, so a retry or a late run sets the same moment and a
  daily chain catches up in order after an outage. Each deadline comes due once per moment, the
  earliest first and the field name breaking a tie; none runs once the process has ended. A deadline
  waits, for at most ten worker rounds, until the process runner has handled the events stored
  before it, and `app.getLag()` counts the ones waiting in `waitingDeadlines`. A failing deadline is
  retried with the process's retry settings, and one that gives up fails the process and is
  dead-lettered as `deadline:<field>`; retrying it runs the deadline again. Commands a deadline
  sends start a new chain, so a repeated reminder never reaches `maxChainDepth`. Boot refuses a
  `deadline()` without its `at-` file and an `at-` file without its `deadline()`, naming the file.
  The `+types` of every process handler now checks what the handler returns against the state
  (`Process.ReturnCheck`), so a field of the wrong type, or a plain string for a deadline, no longer
  compiles.
  
  Breaking: the time-out handler is `at-timeout.ts`, typed `Process.DeadlineArgs`, instead of
  `on-timeout.ts` and `Process.TimeoutArgs`; `bounda generate` says so for a file left behind. The
  time-out now counts from the starting event's time. For code that does not come from
  `bounda generate`, `ProcessTimeoutArgs` is gone in favour of `ProcessDeadlineArgs`, and `ProcessStateArgs` gains
  `deadline` and `instant`. The process runner keeps one scheduler entry per instance,
  `bounda.ProcessDeadline`, in place of `bounda.ProcessTimeout`, and records
  `ProcessDeadlineReached` when a deadline comes due. For adapter authors, the `Scheduler` store gains
  `defer`, which hands a claimed command back without counting an attempt, and `schedule` takes
  `keepTimingOfSameCommand`, which leaves an entry that already holds the same command and context
  as it is, a pending retry included. The Cloudflare client's
  `getLag()` is typed with the new `AppLag`, `waitingDeadlines` included.
- eb83b61: What a process handler returns is merged over its state, as `Partial<State>` already promised. A
  handler returned `{ paymentDeadline: null }` and the runtime parsed it as the whole state, so every
  field it left out went back to its default without a word: a `paymentId` set earlier became `null`
  and the compensation that needed it did nothing. A handler now returns only the fields that change,
  or nothing to keep the state. The merge is shallow, so a nested object is replaced whole, and a
  field goes back to its default only when the handler sets it; one returned as `undefined` keeps its
  value. A handler that returns anything but an object or nothing fails the process, a deadline
  handler's `null` and a process without `state` included. The `ReturnCheck` of an `at-<field>.ts`
  requires its field, as `null` or another moment, so leaving it out no longer compiles;
  `ProcessDeadlineResult` is the type it checks against. And a handler that returns a field its state
  does not declare no longer compiles, so a misspelt one is not dropped by the schema without a word;
  in a process without `state`, that is any field.
- dbc6876: One name per concept across the public API, the CLI and the stored rows.
  
  Breaking:
  
  - A dead letter is retried, not replayed: `app.deadLetters.replay(id)` is `retry(id)`, the status
    `replayed` is `retried`, and `bounda dead-letters replay <id>` is `bounda dead-letters retry <id>`.
    On Cloudflare, the client's `deadLetters.replay` is `deadLetters.retry` and the object's RPC
    method `replayDeadLetter` is `retryDeadLetter`. Replay is kept for reprocessing history.
  - "Subscriber" names only the group that keeps a checkpoint (`policies`, `processes`,
    `projection:<read model>`). The policy, process or scheduled command a dead letter or an inbox
    claim belongs to is its `handler`: `DeadLetter.subscriber` and the `subscriber` filter of
    `deadLetters.list` and `count` are `handler`, `bounda dead-letters list --subscriber` is
    `--handler`, `ClaimLostError.subscriber` is `handler`, and the `InboxLedger` store keys claims by
    `handler`. The `subscriber` column of the inbox and dead-letter tables is `handler`, and the
    `bounda.dead_letters` counter carries `bounda.handler` and `bounda.handler.kind` instead of
    `bounda.subscriber` and `bounda.subscriber.kind`, which stay on the dispatch span and the lag
    gauge.
  - A command dispatched with `delay` is a scheduled command everywhere: its dead letters have kind
    `scheduled` instead of `command` (`--kind scheduled` in the CLI and on the counter) and the
    command type as their `handler` instead of `scheduled:<CommandType>`, the event written when one
    fails for good is `ScheduledCommandFailed` instead of `CommandFailed`, and an invalid payload
    is reported for a "scheduled command".
  - `DeadLetterKind` no longer has `projection`: a projection never files a dead letter.
  - A dead letter that cannot be retried in the app as it now is (its policy, process or scheduled
    command is gone from the registry, its policy or process no longer handles the event, or its
    process instance failed on another step) is refused with the new `DeadLetterNotRetriableError`
    (code `DEAD_LETTER_NOT_RETRIABLE`) without running anything. A policy that no longer reacts to
    the letter's event used to run anyway, and a scheduled command that no longer exists was
    refused with `NotFoundError`.
  - `bounda dead-letters list` refuses a `--kind` or `--status` it does not know instead of listing
    nothing.
  - `consistency: "immediate"` in `@bounda-dev/react-router` is `consistency: "read-your-writes"`,
    still the default, and `createBounda` throws `ConfigurationError` for a value it does not know.
  - `processStreamId`, `ProcessStreamIdFunction` and `PROCESS_STREAM_PREFIX` are removed: nothing
    used them.
  - The storage no longer adds columns to tables an earlier version created, and
    `storageSchemaAdditions` is gone from `@bounda-dev/core/adapter/sqlite` and
    `@bounda-dev/sqlite`: a database created before this version has to be created again.
- b7e87c1: The public API keeps what an app, an adapter or another Bounda package uses, under names that do not clash.
  
  Breaking:
  
  - The storage an adapter opens is `Storage`, and a read model's is `ReadModelStorage` (they were `StoragePorts` and `ReadModelPorts`): "port" now only means the ports of an app.
  - `boot()` and `loadProject()` take `loadEnv: false` to skip `.env`, instead of `env: false`, which read like the environment `createApp` takes as `env`.
  - No longer exported:
    - `@bounda-dev/core`: `createEventBuilders`, `validateRegistry`, `streamId`, `parseDuration`, `uuidV7IdGenerator`, `PROCESS_EVENTS`, `SCHEDULED_COMMAND_FAILED_EVENT`, `ScheduledCommandFailedPayload` and the types that describe the modules inside the registry (`EventModule`, `CommandModule`, `ViewModule` and the like) or only help other types (`Simplify`, `HasPayload`, `InferPayload` and the like).
    - `@bounda-dev/core/config`: `selectImplementations`, `resolveConfig`, the `Resolved*` types but `ResolvedConfig`, the type of `app.config`, and `AdapterDefinition`, which `@bounda-dev/core/adapter` exports.
    - `@bounda-dev/core/adapter`: `isAdapter` and `isAdapterDefinition`.
    - `@bounda-dev/core/adapter/sql` and `@bounda-dev/core/adapter/sqlite`: what the adapters do not use. `/adapter/sqlite` keeps `createSqliteAdapter`.
    - `@bounda-dev/core/memory`: the factories of the single stores. `memory()` stays.
    - `@bounda-dev/cli`: everything but `generate`, `ConventionError`, `formatConventionError`, `formatWarnings` and their types. `GenerateReport` no longer carries the project `model` and the generated `files`.
    - `create-bounda`: everything; it is a command, with no library entry.
    - `@bounda-dev/sqlite` and `@bounda-dev/postgresql`: `storageTablesFor`, `storageSchemaStatements`, `StorageTables`, `resolve*Options`, the `DEFAULT_*` constants and the database types. Bounda creates and evolves its tables itself.
    - `@bounda-dev/cloudflare`: `durableObjectAdapter`, `createDurableSqlDatabase`, `nextWake`, `workersLogger`, `TENANT_HEADER` and `DEFAULT_TABLE_PREFIX`.
  
  Fixed:
  
  - An event builder takes what the event's payload schema takes as input, which the command pipeline validates when it stores the event. It used to demand the output, so a schema with a transform rejected a correctly typed call and a field with a default was required.
  - `ProjectionArgs.client` is typed as the `ReadClient` a projection receives, as a query's repository has it, instead of `unknown`.
  - JSDoc: test ports are by aggregate or read model; `ConfigurationError` says when it is thrown; the policy and process settings say what `timeout`, `retry` and `maxChainDepth` govern; `TestApp`, `BootArgs` and `MemoryAdapter` are documented.
- 0d485b7: An event is now identified by its aggregate and its type, so two aggregates may name an event the
  same and a handler that reacts to one never sees the other. Policies, processes, projections and
  read-your-writes route by `(aggregate, type)`; before, a policy or projection reacted to every
  event with its type name, whichever aggregate it came from.
  
  The layout follows one rule: a file refers to the events of the aggregate it sits in, and a folder
  named after another aggregate holds what reacts to that aggregate's events.
  
  - A policy can react to another aggregate's events from `policies/<aggregate>/`; its key carries
    the aggregate (`paymentRefundOnPaymentFailed`) and its event is typed against that aggregate.
  - Projections move to `projections/<aggregate>/<event>.ts`. `bounda generate` rejects a projection
    outside such a folder, a folder that is not an aggregate, a policy named after an aggregate and
    an aggregate's folder of its own policies.
  - A policy whose trigger is not an event of the aggregate it listens to now fails at boot instead
    of never running.
  
  Breaking: move every projection into the folder of its aggregate and run `bounda generate`. A
  hand-written registry groups `projections` by aggregate (`projections.order.orderPlaced`), and a
  policy for another aggregate's events sets `source`. `DispatchResult` carries `aggregateType`.
  Projection names in logs and traces read `order.orderPlaced`, and a read model's
  fingerprint changes, so a rebuild paused before the upgrade starts again.
- 5e22e02: Ports belong to the aggregate, and replace collaborators. A port is a module at the aggregate's
  root, `order/notifier.ts`, that exports its interface named after the file (`Notifier`), and its
  implementations live in `order/infrastructure/notifier/`, one file each with a default export
  (`order/infrastructure/notifier/smtp.ts`). Every handler of the aggregate receives it, its
  commands, policies and processes alike, so a call to the outside world can run in the policy or
  process that reacts to a stored event instead of inside a command handler that a concurrency
  conflict reruns. An implementation imports its port and fulfils it with `satisfies`, and the
  generated registry checks each implementation against it, so one that does not fulfil the
  contract fails `tsc`.
  
  `bounda.config.ts` picks one implementation per port under `ports`, by aggregate and port,
  with the file name as the value: `ports: { order: { notifier: "smtp" } }`. The
  generator emits the type of that section and registers it with `@bounda-dev/core/register`, so
  `defineConfig` rejects a name that does not exist and requires a choice wherever a port has
  several implementations; a port with one may be left out, and no implementation is a default.
  
  Breaking: a command or policy is always a file, the `<collaborator>.<implementation>.ts` files
  next to a command, policy or process are gone, and so are the `commands`, `policies` and
  `processes` sections of the configuration and the `Collaborators` type a module used to export;
  `bounda generate` points at the aggregate root for each. In the registry, the `collaborators`
  of the command, policy and process entries become the aggregate entry's `ports`, typed as
  `PortModules`; `CollaboratorImplementations`, `InferCollaborators`,
  `CollaboratorSelection`, `ReactionsConfig` and `selectCollaborators` are gone, and
  `ImplementationModule`, `PortsConfig` and `PortsSection` are new. `bounda generate`
  rejects a port named after a handler argument (`command`, `state`, `events`, `event`, `commands`,
  `idempotencyKey`, `signal`, `aggregateId`, `after`, `reject`) or after an event of its aggregate.
  Run `bounda generate` to update generated files.
- 66560ea: A policy or process run that fails no longer leaves its scheduled commands behind, and one that runs
  out of time no longer keeps dispatching commands.
  
  - When a handler throws, times out, or its outcome cannot be recorded, the scheduled commands that
    run scheduled are cancelled. A retry that takes another path used to leave them in the scheduler,
    where they ran when due, even after the reaction was dead-lettered.
  - When a handler runs out of time, the commands it dispatches from then on are refused with an
    error whose `code` is `REACTION_ABANDONED` and whose `cause` is the timeout. Before, the
    abandoned handler kept running and its commands kept going out.
  - Policy, process and deadline handlers receive `signal`, an `AbortSignal` that aborts when their
    run times out or fails: pass it to calls outside (`fetch(url, { signal })`) so they stop too.
    `bounda generate` reserves the name, so a port can no longer be called `signal`.
- c59bad8: A read model can have ports, as an aggregate does: `order-summary/rates.ts` exports the interface
  and `order-summary/infrastructure/rates/` holds its implementations. Only its queries' `handler`
  receives them, next to `query`, `repositoryData`, `table` and `queries`; `repository`, which reads
  the storage, and the projections do not. A projection commits with its checkpoint in one
  transaction, runs again on a rebuild and runs inside a command's request, so a call to the outside
  from it would repeat, change the rows a rebuild produces, or slow every command. The root of a read
  model also holds any module of the app's own, and `bounda generate` warns about a directory one
  letter away from `projections`, `queries` or `infrastructure`.
  
  `bounda.config.ts` chooses a read model's implementations in the same `ports` section, by read model
  and port (`ports: { orderSummary: { rates: "ecb" } }`), and `createTestApp` takes their doubles the
  same way. `.bounda/types.ts` gains `<ReadModel>Ports`, and `Query.HandlerArgs` takes it. A read
  model's port cannot be called `view`, `query`, `repositoryData`, `table` or `queries`, and a module
  at a read model's root that exports `project`, `repository` or `handler` is warned about, since
  it belongs in `projections/` or `queries/`.
- b3c906e: `createTestApp` takes `ports`, by aggregate and port: a double written in the test, which
  the handlers receive as it is and `app.stop()` never closes, or an implementation's file name,
  built as the app would build it. A test can now pass a stub that rejects or a spy without a file
  per scenario, and tests no longer share state through an implementation module.
  
  Breaking: `createTestApp`'s `config` no longer chooses implementations, and a port's only
  implementation is no longer picked. A port the test leaves out has no implementation, so a test never reaches a
  provider it did not ask for: reading it throws a `ConfigurationError` that says what to pass. A
  command rejects with it, a policy or a process sends it to its dead letter without retrying, and
  from then on every `app.runUntilIdle()` throws it.
  
  The generator emits `TestPorts` in `.bounda/types.ts` and registers it with
  `@bounda-dev/core/register` as `testPorts`, which the new `AppTestPorts` reads, falling back to
  the new `TestPortsChoice`. Run `bounda generate` to update generated
  files.

### Patch Changes

- ad63276: Refuse a policy and a process of one aggregate with the same name. The inbox records a handled event by the reaction's name alone, so the two would each skip, silently, the events the other had handled: a process never opened its instance. `bounda generate` now rejects `policies/checkout.ts` next to `processes/checkout/`, and two policies whose keys meet (`policies/payment-refund-on-payment-failed.ts` next to `policies/payment/refund-on-payment-failed.ts`); boot rejects a registry whose policy and process share a name.
- e7d0782: A port implementation can export `create` instead of a default, never both, to build the
  port when the app starts: a client, a pool, a secret. It receives `{ env, logger, clock }`, may be
  async and runs once per app: once per process under `boot()`, once per Durable Object, once per
  `createTestApp`. `env` is the host's environment: `process.env` after `.env` is loaded under
  `boot()`, the Durable Object's `env` on Cloudflare (typed as `Cloudflare.Env`, which
  `@bounda-dev/cloudflare` registers with `@bounda-dev/core/register`), and what a test
  passes as `createTestApp({ env })`, an empty object otherwise. `createApp` takes `env` as well;
  both require it when the registered environment is one an empty object does not satisfy, as
  `Cloudflare.Env` is, and some implementation of the registry exports `create` (`EnvSection`).
  `CreateAppArgs` and `CreateTestAppArgs` become type aliases.
  `app.stop()` calls `[Symbol.asyncDispose]` on what each `create` returned, after closing the
  storage and in reverse order; one that fails to close is logged and the rest still close. A
  default export is never closed.
  
  `create` is typed as `CreateImplementation<Port>`; `CreateArgs`, `CreateImplementation`, `AppEnv`
  and `EnvSection` are new public types, and
  `ImplementationModule` accepts either export. The registry check rejects a module that exports
  both or neither. Run `bounda generate` to update generated files.
- a77e479: Tighten the JSDoc of the public API to what it guarantees, and correct the comments that no longer matched the code: `boundaMiddleware` is mounted with `export const middleware = [boundaMiddleware]`, `schemaVersion` follows the event's upcasts, and a superseded rebuild's abort does nothing.
- 6d6a8b8: `bounda generate --watch` no longer misses a change saved just after it starts. On macOS the file
  system starts listening some time after the watch is set up and drops what changes before, so
  the watch said it was listening when it was not. It now writes a cookie file,
  `.bounda-watch-<uuid>`, into the application directory until it hears it back and removes it;
  `--watch` makes its first run from then on. When the cookie has not come back after 20 writes, a
  second, `--watch` warns that watching may miss changes, makes its first run and goes on watching.

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 774e68e: The first release out of alpha. Everything the alphas shipped is in, and from here the API changes
  only between minor versions, with every change that breaks something called out in this
  changelog, until 1.0.
  
  Bounda 0.1 is event sourcing and CQRS for TypeScript on one database: modules that export functions
  under `app/domain` and `app/read`, with every type generated by `bounda generate`; commands with
  optimistic concurrency; policies and processes that run once per event, with retries and dead
  letters; scheduled commands; read models whose projections apply every event exactly once and
  spread over instances, rebuilt without going offline; read-your-writes; SQLite, libSQL,
  PostgreSQL or one Cloudflare Durable Object per store; OpenTelemetry spans and metrics; a React
  Router integration and `create-bounda`. The alpha entries below have the details.

  - @bounda-dev/core@0.1.0-alpha.9

## 0.1.0-alpha.8

### Minor Changes

- 312cc35: `watchProject` takes an optional `clock`, the `Clock` from `@bounda-dev/core` that its quiet time is
  measured on. It defaults to the wall clock, so nothing changes unless you pass one; with
  `createFixedClock()` a test decides when a burst of changes goes to `onChange`.

### Patch Changes

- 05da3fa: `bounda generate --watch` starts watching before its first run instead of after it, so a module
  saved while that run is going is regenerated right after it rather than at the next change. It
  prints `watching app/ for changes` once the watcher is listening; it used to print the line first
  and start watching after.

## 0.1.0-alpha.5

### Patch Changes

- 01642b8: Dead letters get a way out. `app.deadLetters` lists, counts, replays and discards the handler
  runs that gave up, and `bounda dead-letters list | replay <id> | discard <id>` does the same from
  the command line. A replay runs the failed policy or process handler again for its stored event,
  or dispatches the dropped scheduled command again; a process that had failed is back to `started`
  with its timeout re-armed at the original deadline. Command dead letters now record the command's
  payload, in a new nullable `payload` column the adapters add to existing databases on start.
- 78f9b01: Rebuild a read model without taking it offline. `bounda rebuild <read-model>` projects the whole
  stream into a fresh table with the view's current fields while queries keep reading the live one,
  then swaps the two in a single transaction and moves the read model's checkpoint to where the
  rebuild stopped; a worker that got further re-projects the difference. It is the path for a
  projection that had a bug and for a view that lost a field or changed a field's type, which the
  app still refuses to do on start, now naming the command. `rebuildReadModel` and
  `app.rebuildReadModel(name)` in `@bounda-dev/core`, `loadProject` in `@bounda-dev/core/node`,
  and `rebuildReadModel` in the adapter SPI; the in-memory adapter now shares one storage per
  instance so that a rebuild sees the same events as the app.
- 138ac4a: Upcasts. When an event's payload changes shape after events are stored, `<event>.upcast.ts`
  next to the event exports `upcasts`: one function per past version, oldest first, the last one
  producing today's payload, which `Event.Upcasts` from the event's `+types` checks. The runtime
  stamps new events with `schemaVersion = upcasts.length + 1` and, on every read, applies the
  upcasts from the stored version on, so `apply`, policies, processes, projections and rebuilds only
  ever see the current shape. An event written with a version the running code does not know is
  refused. The generator recognises the module and emits it under `upcasts` in the registry.

## 0.1.0-alpha.3

### Patch Changes

- 9e26090: Document installing without a dist-tag. While every published version is a prerelease, changesets
  publishes to `latest`, so `npm create bounda@alpha` resolved to an older alpha than a plain
  `npm create bounda`.

## 0.1.0-alpha.2

### Patch Changes

- @bounda-dev/core@0.1.0-alpha.2

## 0.1.0-alpha.1

### Minor Changes

- 2f9d007: First alpha.
  
  Bounda runs an event-sourced app from the files you write: aggregates, commands, events,
  policies, processes and read models under `app/domain` and `app/read`, wired by a generator that
  also writes every argument type. One database holds the events, the read models, the schedule and
  the dead letters.
  
  - `@bounda-dev/core`: the runtime. Commands append with optimistic concurrency, projections and
    policies run through a dispatcher with checkpoints and at-least-once delivery, processes are
    internal aggregates with time-outs, and queries compose. `boot()` for Node, `createTestApp()`
    for tests, an in-memory adapter and the ports to write your own.
  - `@bounda-dev/cli`: `bounda generate` reads the layout by file names alone and writes the
    registry, the types and a `+types` module next to every file. State is inferred from the `apply`
    functions when an aggregate has no `state.ts`.
  - `@bounda-dev/adapter-sqlite` and `@bounda-dev/adapter-postgresql`: storage on libSQL or
    PostgreSQL, safe for several processes on one database.
  - `@bounda-dev/react-router`: a Vite plugin and a middleware that boot the app once and hand it to
    every loader and action, reading its own writes by default.
  - `create-bounda`: `npm create bounda@alpha`, with a Node or a React Router project.
