# @bounda-dev/adapter-cloudflare

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 04e643b: `importPath` prefixes a target inside a directory whose name starts with a dot with `./`, so
  importing `.bounda/registry.ts` from the project root no longer yields a bare specifier.
  `create-bounda` exports `Framework` and `FRAMEWORKS`, which `CreateOptions` already used, and
  `@bounda-dev/adapter-cloudflare` no longer exports `ConfigForObjectFunction`, the type of a
  function it never exported. The `createBounda` example and the React Router README no longer call
  a `payloadOf` helper that does not exist, and the `DomainError` JSDoc says what it does in a policy
  or a process: it is terminal, and the run is dead-lettered at once.

### Patch Changes

- 7b2f7a0: `connect()` checks a command's `signal` before calling the object and leaves it out of the call,
  since RPC cannot carry it, instead of failing to send the command. The worker answers
  `HANDLER_TIMEOUT` with 504.
- e7d0782: A collaborator implementation can export `create` instead of a default, never both, to build the
  port when the app starts: a client, a pool, a secret. It receives `{ env, logger, clock }`, may be
  async and runs once per app: once per process under `boot()`, once per Durable Object, once per
  `createTestApp`. `env` is the host's environment: `process.env` after `.env` is loaded under
  `boot()`, the Durable Object's `env` on Cloudflare (typed as `Cloudflare.Env`, which
  `@bounda-dev/adapter-cloudflare` registers with `@bounda-dev/core/register`), and what a test
  passes as `createTestApp({ env })`, an empty object otherwise. `createApp` takes `env` as well;
  both require it when the registered environment is one an empty object does not satisfy, as
  `Cloudflare.Env` is, and some implementation of the registry exports `create` (`EnvSection`).
  `CreateAppArgs` and `CreateTestAppArgs` become type aliases.
  `app.stop()` calls `[Symbol.asyncDispose]` on what each `create` returned, after closing the
  storage and in reverse order; one that fails to close is logged and the rest still close. A
  default export is never closed.
  
  The `+types` of an implementation adds `Implementation.Create` and `Implementation.CreateArgs`;
  `CreateArgs`, `CreateImplementation`, `AppEnv` and `EnvSection` are new public types, and
  `ImplementationModule` accepts either export. `selectCollaborators` now returns the chosen module
  rather than its default export, and the registry check rejects a module that exports both or
  neither. Run `bounda generate` to update generated files.
- 6c504e1: Processes have deadlines, and a deadline is state. A field of a process `state` declared with
  `deadline()` is a moment the process acts at: a handler schedules it by setting it with
  `after("24h")`, moves it by changing it and cancels it with `null`, and `at-<field>.ts` runs when
  it comes due (`nextReminder` runs `at-next-reminder.ts`). `instant()` declares a moment the process
  only records. Both are `Instant`s, ISO 8601 strings in UTC; `asInstant` makes one for a test.
  `after()`, which every process handler now receives, counts from what triggered the handler, the
  event's time or the moment that came due, so a retry or a late run sets the same moment and a
  daily chain catches up in order after an outage. Each deadline comes due once per moment, the
  earliest first and the field name breaking a tie; none runs once the process has ended. A deadline
  waits, for at most ten worker rounds, until the process runner has handled the events stored
  before it, and `app.getLag()` counts the ones waiting in `waitingDeadlines`. A failing deadline is
  retried with the process's retry settings, and one that gives up fails the process and is
  dead-lettered as `deadline:<field>`; replaying it runs the deadline again. Commands a deadline
  sends start a new chain, so a repeated reminder never reaches `maxChainDepth`. Boot refuses a
  `deadline()` without its `at-` file and an `at-` file without its `deadline()`, naming the file.
  The `+types` of every process handler now checks what the handler returns against the state
  (`Process.ReturnCheck`), so a field of the wrong type, or a plain string for a deadline, no longer
  compiles.
  
  Breaking: the time-out handler is `at-timeout.ts`, typed `Process.DeadlineArgs`, instead of
  `on-timeout.ts` and `Process.TimeoutArgs`; `bounda generate` says so for a file left behind. The
  time-out now counts from the starting event's time. For code that does not come from
  `bounda generate`, `ProcessEntry.timeout` is `ProcessEntry.deadlines.timeout`,
  `ProcessTimeoutArgs` is gone in favour of `ProcessDeadlineArgs`, and `ProcessStateArgs` gains
  `deadline` and `instant`. The process runner keeps one scheduler entry per instance,
  `bounda.ProcessDeadline`, in place of `bounda.ProcessTimeout`, and records
  `ProcessDeadlineReached` when a deadline comes due. For adapter authors, the `Scheduler` port gains
  `defer`, which hands a claimed command back without counting an attempt, and `schedule` takes
  `keepTimingOfSameCommand`, which leaves an entry that already holds the same command and context
  as it is, a pending retry included. The Cloudflare client's
  `getLag()` is typed with the new `AppLag`, `waitingDeadlines` included.
- a77e479: Tighten the JSDoc of the public API to what it guarantees, and correct the comments that no longer matched the code: `boundaMiddleware` is mounted with `export const middleware = [boundaMiddleware]`, `schemaVersion` follows the event's upcasts, and a superseded rebuild's abort does nothing.

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 774e68e: The first release out of alpha. Everything the alphas shipped is in, and from here the API changes
  only between minor versions, with every change that breaks something called out in this
  changelog, until 1.0.
  
  Bounda 0.1 is event sourcing and CQRS for TypeScript on one database: modules that export functions
  under `app/domain` and `app/read`, with every type generated by `bounda generate`; commands with
  optimistic concurrency; policies and processes that run once per event, with retries and dead
  letters; scheduled commands; read models whose projections apply every event exactly once and
  spread over instances, rebuilt without going offline; read-your-writes; SQLite, libSQL,
  PostgreSQL or one Cloudflare Durable Object per store; OpenTelemetry spans and metrics; a React
  Router integration and `create-bounda`. The alpha entries below have the details.

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [774e68e]
  - @bounda-dev/core@0.1.0

## 0.1.0-alpha.9

### Minor Changes

- 62b62bc: Read-your-writes waits for your events, not for everything. A command's result now carries
  `eventTypes` and `position`, the place of its last event in the global stream, and
  `app.catchUpReadModels({ through: result })` waits only for the read models that project one of
  those types, only until they reach that position. A read model already there costs one checkpoint
  read; one behind is projected by the caller when no other process holds it, and when the worker
  is busy with it the caller reads its checkpoint again every 15 ms instead of queueing on its lock,
  so a web request no longer keeps a database connection waiting or projects other users' events.
  The wait runs outside the dispatcher's pass mutex, and it is bounded by
  `runtime.dispatcher.catchUp.timeout` (2 s): past it the command resolves anyway and a warning names
  the read models still behind. `readYourWrites`, and with it React Router's
  `consistency: "immediate"`, and the Durable Object's commands use it. `catchUpReadModels()`
  without arguments still catches every read model up.

## 0.1.0-alpha.8

### Minor Changes

- 2083e68: Projections apply every event exactly once, with any number of instances. Each batch now runs in
  one transaction on the read model's database that writes the rows and advances the checkpoint
  together, holding a lock named after the read model: `pg_advisory_xact_lock` on PostgreSQL, the
  single writer on SQLite and libSQL, the storage transaction in a Durable Object. Two bugs are gone
  with it: an instance that fell behind could apply an old batch over rows a faster instance had
  already moved past, leaving them wrong with no lag to show for it, and a batch redelivered after a
  projection threw halfway applied its first events twice, which counted twice in a projection that
  reads a row to update it. Background passes skip a read model another instance holds, so read
  models spread over the workers; `processUntilIdle`, `catchUpReadModels` and read-your-writes wait
  for it. Inside a batch, a projection's `client.raw` is the driver's transaction handle.
  
  A batch keeps its transaction open for at most the new `runtime.dispatcher.projectionBatchTime`,
  250 ms by default, and commits what it got through when it runs out.
  
  Rebuilds are exact too: every batch commits with its progress, so an interrupted rebuild resumes
  without projecting anything twice, and the swap sets the read model's checkpoint to the rebuilt
  position under the projection lock instead of only moving it back.
  
  A read model configured on a database of its own keeps its checkpoint and its rebuild progress in
  that database.
  
  Breaking for adapter authors: `ReadModelPorts` gains `checkpointStore` and `transact`;
  `ReadModelRebuild` gains `position`, `checkpointStore` and `transact`, and `commit` takes the
  subscriber and position; `CreateReadModelRebuildArgs` takes `progress` instead of `resume`;
  `SqlDatabase.write` hands its work a `SqlTransaction` that carries the driver's `raw` handle.
- 5d81066: Two rebuilds of the same read model no longer write at once. They used to share the shadow table
  and its progress, so the second could drop the table the first was filling, and either could swap
  in rows the other had half written. Opening a rebuild now claims the next generation of that read
  model under a lock, and every batch, the commit and the abort go ahead only while that generation
  is still the latest: the rebuild started last takes over, resuming where the other got when the
  code is the same, and the older one stops at its next step with the new `RebuildSupersededError`
  (`REBUILD_SUPERSEDED`) without writing or dropping anything. A rebuild whose process died needs no
  timeout to be replaced. `rebuildFencing` in `@bounda-dev/core/adapter` names the lock and the
  generation checkpoint for adapter authors.
  
  On Cloudflare, an alarm slice that another rebuild took over is logged at `info` as
  `bounda rebuild slice taken over by another rebuild` instead of as a failed slice, and is not
  retried as one: the rebuild that took over carries on.

## 0.1.0-alpha.7

### Patch Changes

- 76285dd: `npm create bounda` offers Cloudflare: a Worker with a Bounda Durable Object per tenant, the
  events, read models and scheduled work in the object's own SQLite. The adapter is documented at
  docs.bounda.dev/adapters/cloudflare.
- f7ce38a: A read model rebuild can run in slices and resumes where it stopped. `rebuildReadModel` and
  `app.rebuildReadModel` take `maxEvents` and answer `done`; the position reached is saved after
  every batch, keyed by a fingerprint of the read model's fields and projections, so an interrupted
  `bounda rebuild` picks up where it was unless the code changed, and `app.pendingRebuilds()` lists
  what is waiting. On Cloudflare the Durable Object runs the first slice in the request and the
  rest in its alarm (`eventsPerRebuildSlice`, 5,000 by default). Adapters gain `resume` and
  `pause` in their rebuild.
- 9d9b670: A Bounda Durable Object works the same on every compatibility date. Workers before the 2026
  dates drop an error's own properties on the way across RPC, so `createWorker` answered 500 for a
  domain error or an invalid payload; the object now answers each call with an outcome, and
  `connect` and `createWorker` throw refusals again with `name`, `message`, `code` and `issues`.
  A handler that throws is no longer reported as an unhandled rejection by workerd on those dates.
